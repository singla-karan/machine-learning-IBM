# Machine Learning Projects (IBM)

Following are the projects and their description I have done in Machine Learning with python:

## Regression

### 1. Mulitple Linear Regression

- Estimated carbon dioxide emissions for cars which are still not produced.
- Use scikit-learn to implement Multiple Linear Regression.
- Create a model, train it, test it and use the model.

### 2. Non-Linear Regression.ipynb

- Use non-linear regression model in Python.
- Quadratic, Exponential, Logarithmic & Sigmoidal/Logistic.

### 3. Polynomial Regression.ipynb

- Estimated carbon dioxide emissions for cars which are still not produced.
- Use scikit-learn to implement Polynomial Regression.
- Create a model, train it, test it and use the model.

## Classification

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors.ipynb

- Use K Nearest neighbors to classify data.
- The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service. *My objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases.*

### 5. Decision Trees.ipynb

- I will use this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then I will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
- Develop a classification model using Decision Tree Algorithm.

### 6. Logistic Regression.ipynb

- I will create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.
- Use scikit Logistic Regression to classify.
- Understand confusion matrix.

### 7. SVM (Support Vector Machines)

- I will use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
- Use scikit-learn to Support Vector Machine to classify.

## Clustering

### 8. K-Means Clustering.ipynb

- Using k-means for customer segmentation.
- Use scikit-learn's K-Means Clustering to cluster data

### 9. Hierarchical Clustering.ipynb

- My objective in this notebook, is to use clustering methods, to find the most distinctive clusters of vehicles. It will summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacturers to make decision about the supply of new models.
- Use scikit-learn to Hierarchical clustering.
- Create dendograms to visualize the clustering.

### 10. DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)

- Cluster the location of weather stations in Canada, for instance, to find the group of stations which show the same weather condition.
- Use DBSCAN to do Density based clustering
- Use Matplotlib to plot clusters

## Recommender Systems

### 11. Recommendation Systems - Content Based Filtering

- Recommending movies based on content based or Item-Item recommendation systems.

### 12. Recommendation Systems - Collaborative Filtering

- Recommending movies based on Collaborative Filtering or User-User Filtering.
